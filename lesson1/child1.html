        <div class="float_center">
            <h2>The Name<a name="the_name"></a></h2>
            <p>The Java- prefix suggests that JavaScript is somehow related to Java, that it is a subset or less capable version of Java. It seems that the name was intentionally selected to create confusion, and from confusion comes misunderstanding. JavaScript is not interpreted Java. Java is interpreted Java. JavaScript is a different language.</p>
            <p>JavaScript has a syntactic similarity to Java, much as Java has to C. But it is no more a subset of Java than Java is a subset of C. It is better than Java in the applications that Java (fka Oak) was originally intended for.</p>
            <p>JavaScript was not developed at Sun Microsystems, the home of Java. JavaScript was developed at Netscape. It was originally called LiveScript, but that name wasn't confusing enough.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="float_center">
            <h2>Lisp in C's Clothing<a name="lisp"></a></h2>
            <p>JavaScript's C-like syntax, including curly braces and the clunky for statement, makes it appear to be an ordinary procedural language. This is misleading because JavaScript has more in common with functional languages like Lisp or Scheme than with C or Java. It has arrays instead of lists and objects instead of property lists. Functions are first class. It has closures. You get lambdas without having to balance all those parens.</p>
            <p>JavaScript was designed to run in Netscape Navigator. Its success there led to it becoming standard equipment in virtually all web browsers. This has resulted in typecasting. JavaScript is the George Reeves of programming languages. JavaScript is well suited to a large class of non-Web-related applications</p>

            <h2>Moving Target<a name="moving_target"></a></h2>
            <p>The first versions of JavaScript were quite weak. They lacked exception handling, inner functions, and inheritance. In its present form, it is now a complete object-oriented programming language. But many opinions of the language are based on its immature forms.</p>
            <p>The ECMA committee that has stewardship over the language is developing extensions which, while well intentioned, will aggravate one of the language's biggest problems: There are already too many versions. This creates confusion.</p>

            <h2>Design Errors<a name="designed_err"></a></h2>
            <p>No programming language is perfect. JavaScript has its share of design errors, such as the overloading of + to mean both addition and concatenation with type coercion, and the error-prone with statement should be avoided. The reserved word policies are much too strict. Semicolon insertion was a huge mistake, as was the notation for literal regular expressions. These mistakes have led to programming errors, and called the design of the language as a whole into question. Fortunately, many of these problems can be mitigated with a good lint program.</p>
            <p>The design of the language on the whole is quite sound. Surprisingly, the ECMAScript committee does not appear to be interested in correcting these problems. Perhaps they are more interested in making new ones.</p>
            <p>Some of the earlier implementations of JavaScript were quite buggy. This reflected badly on the language. Compounding that, those implementations were embedded in horribly buggy web browsers.</p>

        <div class="float_center">
            <h2>Object-Oriented<a name="object_orient"></a></h2>
            <p>Is JavaScript object-oriented? It has objects which can contain data and methods that act upon that data. Objects can contain other objects. It does not have classes, but it does have constructors which do what classes do, including acting as containers for class variables and methods. It does not have class-oriented inheritance, but it does have prototype-oriented inheritance.</p>
            <p>Some argue that JavaScript is not truly object oriented because it does not provide information hiding. That is, objects cannot have private variables and private methods: All members are public.</p>
            <p>But it turns out that JavaScript objects can have private variables and private methods. (Click here now to find out how.) Of course, few understand this because JavaScript is the world's most misunderstood programming language.</p>
            <p>If you wish to start your journey to mastering JavaScript ASAP, well, good news for you: you can begin right about now. Like, right this second, and that's not even an exaggeration. There are no unnecessary installations required with JavaScript. All you need is a trusty program code editor and your internet browser to get started.</p>
            <p>JavaScript is the digital equivalent of the English language in the sense that it's universally recognized. It's also weaved into the fabric of programming. You see it everywhere; you're just not aware of it. JavaScript is present in every platform imaginable — browsers, mobile and desktop applications, IoT devices, and more!</p>
            <p>Even those who have never dipped their toes in programming can be a JavaScript ninja. Its syntax is so straightforward and easily digestible that it can be picked up by beginners in no time.</p>
            <p>If you wish to delve into more complex programming languages, then JavaScript is the perfect springboard. Once you understand it on a deeper level, learning other languages will be a piece of cake.</p>
            <p>Since JavaScript is heavily utilized in front-end development, you can tinker with graphical interfaces however you want. You can play with animation, design beautiful UIs, build games, and so on. The possibilities are endless.</p>
            <p>What do Paypal, Netflix, LinkedIn, and Uber all have in common? They all run on JavaScript — Node.js to be specific. The majority of the world's top websites and apps use JavaScript in one way or another.</p>
            <p>Unlike other languages, JavaScript has a quick feedback loop. Since it's built on the browser, you can run your code and get results instantaneously. That way, you can learn and improve so much faster.</p>
            <p>Since more and more businesses are going digital, there is a high demand for people skilled in JavaScript. And as the programming language continues to grow, the interest in JavaScript developers should also continue to skyrocket.</p>
            <p>JavaScript's ecosystem continues to evolve by the second. There are constant developments, meaning there is also an endless opportunity for growth.
